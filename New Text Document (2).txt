I am interested in this internship because I would like to be useful in this summer vacations ,not to waste it like everyone else. I would like to improve my typing speed as well.
Doing internship at this stage itself bought me some motivation.
I got introduced to ms office and word by my father when i was in school itself ,he helped me make my project thesis by myself.
I am a fast learner ,i think i am well trained in  the environment which i need to work on,so i think this would be the perfect internship for me .

Thanking you


I have exams for 10 days from 27 April ,i am available for the next 2 months after exams full time in Hyderabad during summer vacation , or I can start from now itself as work from home and then after exams I am available full time in Hyderabad.
